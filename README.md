# Git Caffeine!

Git Caffeine is a mock eCommerce storefront where you can (pretend to) buy your favourite caffeinated (or decaf) beverages and related merch. This app is made with React and Firebase. The user can navigate items based on categories, add items to cart, view cart, and remove items from cart. Data persistence is enabled using Firebase.
