# Git Caffeine!

Git Caffeine is a mock eCommerce storefront where you can buy your favourite caffeinated (or decaf) beverages and related merch. This app is made with React and Firebase. 

Future Plans for this app:
- Currently, the app only allows users to add items to the database. Eventually, it'd be good to add a "Cart" functionality that allows the user to view what is in their cart and even remove items from the cart.
